# CaveRace

Classic maze-based video game from 1997.

## Game story

## System requirements

Intel 80386 IBM compatible PC running MS-DOS and VGA 320Ã—200 pixels (Mode 13h) in 256-color mode video system.

## Graphics

The original artwork is created by Marijn Schotte on an Amiga using [Deluxe Paint] in the file format IFF (Interchange File Format). The game CaveRace is using a binary RGB byte file format. Game tiles (16 x 16 pixels) and screens (320 x 200 pixels) are converted to this binary RGB byte file format.

## How to compile

The source code is mainly plain C, but it also has some assembly code for memory and graphics routines. The compiler and linker used is [Borland C] 3.1 (not Turbo C). In Borland C set the working directory to the project folder and you can compile CaveRace and the MapEditor.

## Game cheats

Start the game using the switch **-powerblast**, now you can use the function keys for additional power.

| Key | Result |
| --- | ------ |
| F1  | next level
| F2  | max. health
| F3  | max. bombs
| F4  | more bomb power
| F5  | double points
| 1   | screen capture, output is saved to the file screen.raw
| %   | shows the rendering time

When running the game on old slow systems, you can use the **-slow** switch to speed up the game.
